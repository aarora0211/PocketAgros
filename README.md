# POCKET AGRO

## WHAT IS POCKET AGRO?

It is a program connecting end customers and growers through good food. Everyone buys fruits vegetables from stores all around. But what is the need for the stores to act as mediators? Moreover, why can’t we know what is being grown, what fertilizer is being used and when will the harvesting take place and get the produce delivered right at your door.

## HOW THE APP WORKS?

The main motive of this web-app is to enable farmers, who work hard all day and night to get to interact with the end customers and get a value for their time and effort by working directly according to their needs. On the customer end, it allows the consumers to see with full transparency – how and where their food is coming from and what is going in their plates. It gives them the ability to customize farmers’ farm and be a part of the whole growing process and take out middlemen which take money for no cause.
