      <h2>Overview Description</h2>
      <p>We all want to cook at home because it is healthy, tasty and sometimes even to save money.
        But many times, we are held back because of the limit of ingredients we have at home.
        Sometimes I am craving home-cooked food but end up eating outside because of one or
        more of the following reasons:
        <ol>
          <li>I have very few ingredients at home and they are very random, so I don’t know what to combine with what</li>
          <li>If I go out today and get a good amount of 1 ingredient, say x, I will not know what to do with the extra part of it</li>
          <li>I want to try different things but just know how to cook one</li>
          <li>I want to cut down on calories in my meal but only know how to cook pizza</li>
          <li>I am craving a particular cuisine but don’t know how to cook any dish from that cuisine</li>
        </ol>
        And, the same goes with drinks be it alcoholic or nonalcoholic.
        There are times when you want to have a musky drink while the other times you want to have
        something healthy and refreshing. Then the people go to the internet
        (Just like this to find <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/photos/30-minute-dinner-recipes"> these easy recipies </a>
        and try to find stuff and most of the times they still end up either eating out or staying hungry.
        Now, the internet is such a vast space with so many possibilities and opportunities,
        but because of lack of time and our busy lifestyles, we don’t want to sit and search
        thousands of websites to know how to cook, what to cook,  and then see which meal has
        how many calories and also evaluate how much time it is going to take to make that food.
        There are many different websites and YouTube videos which show us how to cook particular
        dishes. There are websites that show you what is healthy and what is not, and there are
        websites that teach you how to make good cocktails and mocktails. And there are no popular
        websites which tell you what to make with the ingredients you have.But, people need one
        stop one tool which can tell you everything just by a few clicks. And the ones that try to
        do all this like airtable have very confusing user interfaces that the user’s experience is
        definitely going to be bad.

      <h2>App Description</h2>
      <p>The possible solution of these problems can be the creation of the web app called “AllAboutYourFood” because it is after all about the user’s food.
        The expected user of this web app can be anyone with access to internet but more specifically,
        it will be for people with busy lifestyles like working mothers, students etc. Users will get
         a lot of extra functionality alongside basic motive of the app like reviewing recipes,
         sharing pictures of food, meeting up for workouts or even cooking together. But, the basic
          user scenario or flow events will look as follows:
         <ol>
           <li>User, called x from now, is a student and has a very busy schedule and is also trying to lose weight.</li>
           <li> X just came back from a long day of classes and realizes its dinner time but he only has penne and only knows how to make pasta with a pre-made sauce.</li>
           <li>While on call with his friend he discovers this app called AllAboutYourFood and his friend tells him how he has been cooking healthy meals at home with its help and saving money too.</li>
           <li>He opens the app and goes to “What to cook?” from the hamburger menu and when prompted to tell all the ingredients he has he puts in “penne, tomato purée and basil and some herbs and spices”.</li>
           <li>He realizes he gets a list of 5 dishes out of which he choses tomato basil pasta and clicks on it.</li>
           <li>He then gets a notification of an assignment which is due</li>
           <li>But the recipe says 20 mins cook time and very few calories (Bonus Bonus!) and it has 1000 5 star reviews so he decides to make it. He also adds it to his favorites and calendar for the day so that he can track his calories.</li>
           <li>He enjoys his dinner!</li>
        </ol>
